This is the repo for all things related to Workflow 9. The current diagram for Workflow 9 can be found [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/22689882-2099-4acb-961a-fa6202f2cfd8/0).

"GeneCoocurrenceByBicluster_notebook.ipynb" is the first module developed for this workflow and will serve as a template for tissue and combined tissue-gene search modules.
This notebook uses the [smartBag API service] [here](https://smartbag.ncats.io/apidocs/) or [here](https://bicluster.renci.org/apidocs/) for [RNAseqDB biclusters](https://github.com/realmarcin/MAK_results/tree/master/results/RNAseqDB) computed with the [MAK algorithm](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1347092-massive-associative-biclustering-mak-v1).

The primary contact for this is Marcin Joachimiak (MJoachimiak@lbl.gov), with great help from Colin Curtis (ckcurtis@renci.org).
