How the ShinyGO enrichment output was generated:

Ran with Human species (Select Human under box 1)
Ran with default parameters (top 30 most significant terms, P-value cutoff of 0.05 (FDR).

Gene list inputs:
Gene list from Mod1A (Functional Similarity) and the input genes were run through GO Molecular Function enrichment and GO Biological Process enrichment, generating two CSV files. 

Gene list from Mod1B (Phenotypic Similarity) and the input genes were run through Other:HPO enrichment, generating 1 CSV file.
