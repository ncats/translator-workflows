    "The Rosetta workflower API executes graphs of queries to compose the answer to biomedical questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It aims to provide familiar facilities like variables, modularity, extensibility, templates, dependency management, while being responsive to the particular needs of the Translator workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Language\n",
    "\n",
    "- A workflow is a series of steps.\n",
    "- Each step can reference a predefined operation via the **code** tag.\n",
    "   - These operations accept a set of arguments specified via the **args** tag.\n",
    "   - When an operation executes, its result is implicitly stored and can be addressed later by the operator's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables passed to the workflow can be resolved dynamically. In this example, **$disease_name** refers to an argument provided by the execution context to this workflow. The provided value will be substituted at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  diseases:\n",
    "    doc: |\n",
    "      Analogous English to ontological identifier transformation for disease.\n",

    "      type: disease\n",
    "      input: $disease_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query\n",
    "\n",
    "- An operation may query the output of a previous step.\n",
    "- In this way, a \"list\" of genes can be created by querying a structure produced elsewhere in the workflow.\n",
    "- The language currently supports a **select** tag, which, in conjunction with **from** and **where** tags is used to target a JSONPath expression at the output of a previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the output of the name2id service is indexed by the drug_to_phenotypic_feature operation using a JSONPath expression. That job is an instance of the gamma job for querying the Gamma (Robokop) reasoner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently four built in operators: ```name2id, gamma, union, and get```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **name2id** Invokes the Bionames API to resolve a natural language string to ontology identifiers.\n",
    "- **gamma** Invokes the Gamma reasoner. The example below calls Gamma a few times with different machine questions. It will be updated to use the new Quick API for added flexibility. \n",
    "- **union** Unions two or more results into one object.\n",
    "- **get** Invokes an HTTP GET operation on a specified resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect to grow this capability in two ways:\n",
    "- **Adding Core Operators**: By adding intersection and other common graph operations, we can increase the basic capability.\n",
    "- **Templates** The following section describes how users can compose and extend operations to creat their own.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates allow the extension and specialization of existing library functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Synchronous** The prototype runs jobs synchronously.\n",
    "- **Asynchronous** Under development is a task queue based approach.\n",
    "  - The engine builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of jobs.\n",
    "  - A topological sort of the jobs provides the execution order.\n",
    "  - Each job is sent, via an AMQP message queue to an execution back end (Celery).\n",
    "  - Job results are stored in Redis. \n",
    "- Ultimately, other back ends would be good. Currently investigating FireWorks.\n"
