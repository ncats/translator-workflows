    "The Rosetta workflower API executes a multi-step description of a biomedical question.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by applying user supplied arguments to inform a workflow script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment executes workflow operators, managing job interactions (sometimes referred to as \"handoff\") and returns the output of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Language\n",
    "\n",
    "- A workflow is a series of steps.\n",
    "- Each step can reference a predefined operation via the **code** tag.\n",
    "   - These operations accept a set of arguments specified via the **args** tag.\n",
    "   - When an operation executes, its result is implicitly stored and can be addressed later by the operator's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query\n",
    "\n",
    "- An operation may query the output of a previous step.\n",
    "- In this way, a \"list\" of genes can be created by querying a structure produced elsewhere in the workflow.\n",
    "- The language currently supports a **select** tag, which, in conjunction with **from** and **where** tags is used to target a JSONPath expression at the output of a previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the output of the name2id service is indexed by the drug_to_phenotypic_feature operation using a JSONPath expression. That job is an instance of the gamma job for querying the Gamma (Robokop) reasoner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently four built in operators: ```name2id, gamma, union, and get```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **name2id** Invokes the Bionames API to resolve a natural language string to ontology identifiers.\n",
    "- **gamma** Invokes the Gamma reasoner. The example below calls Gamma a few times with different machine questions. It will be updated to use the new Quick API for added flexibility. \n",
    "- **union** Unions two or more results into one object.\n",
    "- **get** Invokes an HTTP GET operation on a specified resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect to grow this capability in two ways:\n",
    "- **Adding Core Operators**: By adding intersection and other common graph operations, we can increase the basic capability.\n",
    "- **Templates** The following section describes how users can compose and extend operations to creat their own.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates allow the extension and specialization of existing library functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "templates:\n",
    "  name2id:\n",
    "    doc: |\n",

    "          type: chemical_substance\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic execution modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Synchronous** The prototype runs jobs synchronously.\n",
    "- **Asynchronous** Under development is a task queue based approach.\n",
    "  - The engine builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of jobs.\n",
    "  - A topological sort of the jobs provides the execution order.\n",
    "  - Each job is sent, via an AMQP message queue to an execution back end (Celery).\n",
    "  - Job results are stored in Redis. \n",
    "- Ultimately, other back ends would be good. Currently investigating FireWorks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Openness\n",
    "\n",
    "- A central goal is to be open to invoking all Translator services.\n",
    "- We hope to do this by providing a core of services that can be composed into new services.\n"
