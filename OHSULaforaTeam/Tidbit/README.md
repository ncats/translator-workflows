Background 
Fanconi anemia is a rare genetic disease featuring characteristic developmental abnormalities, a progressive pancytopenia, genomic instability, and predisposition to cancer [1, 2]. The FA pathway contains a multiprotein core complex, including at least twelve proteins that are required for the monoubiquitylation of the FANCD2/FANCI protein complex and for other functions that are not well understood [3–6]. The core complex includes the Fanconi proteins FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM. At least five additional proteins are associated with the FA core complex, including FAAP100, FAAP24, FAAP20, and the histone fold dimer MHF1/MHF2 [1, 4, 7–10]. The core complex proteins function together as an E3 ubiquitin ligase assembly to monoubiquitylate the heterodimeric FANCI/FANCD2 (ID) complex. The monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 is a surrogate marker for the function of the FA pathway [11]. USP1 and its binding partner UAF1 regulate the deubiquitination of FANCD2 [12]. The breast cancer susceptibility and Fanconi proteins FANCD1/BRCA2, the partner of BRCA2 (PALB2/FANCN), a helicase associated with BRCA1 (FANCJ/BACH1), and several newly identified components including FAN1, FANCO/RAD51C, and FANCP/SLX4 [13–17] participate in the pathway to respond to and repair DNA damage.

Analysis of example output 
Candidate: INIP (INST3- AND NABP-INTERACTING PROTEIN, aka chromosome 9 open reading frame 80; c9orf80 sensor of single-stranded dna complex, subunit c; sossc Soss complex, subunit c 

Note here that the various names of the protein/gene are difficult to follow using literature. Further complicating is that many genes orthologs have different names in different species. This is important because for the first time, translator can perform analyses using datasets in several species, particularly with the Monarch knowledge graph.  Some functional connections may have been discovered in lower organisms and thus these analyses could be expected to give insight into the human protein function. 

Supporting experimental functional relevance for INIP in FA. 

Matches with the G2/M arrest observed in FA cells. 

INIP is a component of the SOSS complex, a multiprotein complex that functions downstream of the MRN complex to promote DNA repair and G2/M checkpoint. 

The SOSS complex associates with single-stranded DNA at DNA lesions and influences diverse endpoints in the cellular DNA damage response including cell-cycle checkpoint activation, recombinational repair and maintenance of genomic stability. 

Required for efficient homologous recombination-dependent repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and ATM-dependent signaling pathways.

INST3- AND NABP-INTERACTING PROTEIN; INIP has been found in screens for Parp inhibotr sensitivity, which is an emerging functional connection with Fanconi, see: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/suppl/2013/11/18/0008-5472.CAN-13-2541.DC1/supp_table_4.pdf

Matches with the phenotype of replication stress and bone marrow failure in Fanconi. 

“Ssb1 and Ssb2 cooperate to regulate mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by resolving replicative stress.”

The actual role of C9ORF80 remains unknown, making it an interesting candidate to further explore as a possible FA modifier. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29150435
